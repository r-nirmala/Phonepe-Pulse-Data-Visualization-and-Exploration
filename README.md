7.Numpy

#### Approach:

1.Cloned the Github repository first, then utilised scripting to retrieve the data from the Phonepe pulse repository and put it in an appropriate format, such CSV.

2.Utilising the pandas libraries, after extracting the data from the github repository, cleaning it up by managing null values, and converting it to a format appropriate for analysis and visualisation.

3.Storing the collected data in a MySQL data warehouse because it enables you to manage and store a lot of structured data in a way that is simple to query and update.

4.Created a dynamic and visually appealing dashboard in Python using the Streamlit and Plotly packages. Designed a user-friendly interface with a variety of dropdown menus so that users could choose which statistics to display.

5.Overall, the outcome of this project is a complete and user-friendly solution for extracting, processing, and visualising data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository.
